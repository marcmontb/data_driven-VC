# data_driven-VC
This project aims to develop a programmatic deal flow origination tool in a venture
capital firm that focuses on early-stage startups by looking for founders and profiles similar to successful
founders, since most early-stage companies do not have any digital presence and traditional
approaches often miss them. This approach will increase deal flow quantity, and, with complementary
fine-tuning, it could increase deal flow quality as well, as it proactively looks for opportunities that fit the
investment scope, whereas current inbound deals are frequently outside this scope.
